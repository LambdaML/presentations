# Reactive Architecture Presentations

Some of my presentations around building [Reactive Architectures](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org).

| Presentation | Video | Description |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| [CQRS/ES with Akka](/pdf/cqrs_es.PDF) | [ny-scala 1.2015](http://www.meetup.com/ny-scala/events/219615402/) | This presentation discusses Command Query Responsibility Segregation with Event Sourcing, and how they are a natural fit for distributed computing. |
| [Autobiography of Building a Reactive Application](/pdf/autobiography_building_ra.pdf) | [Scaladays 2014](http://parleys.com/play/53a7d2cce4b0543940d9e55c/chapter0/about) | This session compares the challenges of monolithic application design in contrast to Reactive application design built on top of CQRS/ES for distributed systems. |
| [Akka Concurrency Works](pdf/akka_concurrency_works.pdf) | [QCon NY 2014](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/akka-concurrency-jvm?utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=QCon_EarlyAccessVideos&utm_campaign=QConNewYork2014) | In this session, we will review the challenges of concurrent programming on the JVM and explore Akka a powerful toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed applications on the JVM. |
| Panel - What's the Best Way to Improve Software Architectures? | [QCon NY 2014](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/panel-improve-software-architecture?utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=QCon_EarlyAccessVideos&utm_campaign=QConNewYork2014) | In this panel we'll pool the minds of the track's speakers and compare the different approaches to keeping software architectures on track. |
| [Lessons Learned in Deploying Akka Persistence](/pdf/lessons-learned-akka-persistence.pdf) | [Akka Days 2014](https://typesafe.com/resources/video/akka-days-webinar-day-1) | In this session I discuss building druable microservice based architectures with Akka Persistence. |
